### **Responsive Web Design**

> * ##### In this Responsive Web Design challenge, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
> * ##### First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.
> * ##### Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

| [**Basic HTML and HTML5**](/HTML%20basic/) | [**Basic CSS and CSS3**](/CSS%20basic/) |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item. | &bull; CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements — the building blocks of any webpage. | &bull; Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS. |

| [**Applied Visual Design**](/Applied%20Visual%20Design/) | [**Applied Accessibility**](/Applied%20Accessbility/) |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message. | &bull; In web development, accessibility refers to web content and a UI (user interface) that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages. | &bull; In this course, you'll learn best practices for building webpages that are accessible to everyone. |
| [**Responsive Web Design Principles**](/Responsive%20Web%20Design%20Principles/) | [**CSS Flexbox**](/CSS%20Flexbox/) |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; There are many devices that can access the web, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions. | &bull; Flexbox is a powerful, well-supported layout method that was introduced with the latest version of CSS, CSS3. With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn how to use CSS to make your webpages look good, no matter what device they're viewed on. | &bull; In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of flexbox and dynamic layouts by building a Twitter card. |

| [**CSS Grid**](/CSS%20Grid/) | [**Responsive Web Design Projects**](/Responsive%20Web%20design%20Projects/) |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to build complex responsive layouts. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid, and lets you place child elements anywhere within. | &bull; Time to put your newly learnt skills to work. By working on these projects, you will get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of CSS grid by building different complex layouts, including a blog. | |

### **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**

> * ##### While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
> * ##### Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
> * ##### Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).

| [**Basic JavaScript**]() | [**ES6**](/ES6/) |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers. | &bull; ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. | &bull; Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year. |
| | &bull; ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules. |

| [**Regular Expressions**]() | [**Debugging**]() |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches. | &bull; Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want. | &bull; Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended. |
| | &bull; In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen. |

| [**Basic Data Structures**]() | [**Basic Algorithm Scripting**]() |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures — arrays and objects. | &bull; An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something. |
| &bull; In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like ```splice()``` and ```Object.keys()``` to access and manipulate data. | &bull; To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code. |
| | &bull; In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays. |

| [**Object Oriented Programming**]() | [**Functional Programming**]() |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do. | &bull; Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs. |
| &bull; In this course, you'll learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the ```this``` keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance. | &bull; In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like ```.map()``` and ```.filter()```. |

| [**Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**]() | [**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects**]() |
| --- | --- |
| &bull; Now that you know the basics of algorithmic thinking, along with OOP and Functional Programming, test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges. | &bull; This is it — time to put your new JavaScript skills to work. These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges you've done before – just much more difficult. |
